### Calculate Columns

#### Converting ages into age range: 

             age_range = if(AND(users[age]>21, users[age]<30), "21-30", 
    if(AND(users[age]>31, users[age]<40), "31-40",
    if(AND(users[age]>41, users[age]<50), "41-50",
    if(AND(users[age]>51, users[age]<60), "51-60",
    if(AND(users[age]>61, users[age]<70), "61-70",
    if(AND(users[age]>71, users[age]<80), "71-80","81-90"
    ))))))

#### Route tells that customers travel from one city to another: 

             route = CONCATENATE([travelfrom - Copy.2.1] & " - ",  [travelto - Copy.2.1])

### Calculate Measures

#### Calculate Average price of Flights: 
         average_price = AVERAGE(flights[price])

#### Calculate number of flight types:          
         Flight_Type = DISTINCTCOUNT(flights[flightType])

### Key Insights

- Flying Drop (38758) has a considerably lower number of flights compared to Cloudify (116378) and Rainbow (116752). This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that Flying Drop exclusively offers first-class flights, which inherently limits its service to a niche market segment.

- Upon analyzing the relationship between flight distance and pricing, it is evident that there is no consistent pattern of price increase with increasing distance. The data reveals that while some longer flights are indeed more expensive, there are numerous instances where prices do not increase proportionally with distance. In fact, at certain points, the prices actually decrease as the distance increases.
