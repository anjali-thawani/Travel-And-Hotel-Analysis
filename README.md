### Calculate Columns

#### Converting ages into age range: 

             age_range = if(AND(users[age]>21, users[age]<30), "21-30", 
    if(AND(users[age]>31, users[age]<40), "31-40",
    if(AND(users[age]>41, users[age]<50), "41-50",
    if(AND(users[age]>51, users[age]<60), "51-60",
    if(AND(users[age]>61, users[age]<70), "61-70",
    if(AND(users[age]>71, users[age]<80), "71-80","81-90"
    ))))))

#### Route tells that customers travel from one city to another: 

             route = CONCATENATE([travelfrom - Copy.2.1] & " - ",  [travelto - Copy.2.1])

### Calculate Measures

#### Calculate Average price of Flights: 
         average_price = AVERAGE(flights[price])

#### Calculate number of flight types:          
         Flight_Type = DISTINCTCOUNT(flights[flightType])

#### Calculate total number of flights:          
         total_no_of_flights = COUNT(flights[travelCode])

#### Calculate total number of users: 
         total_no_of_customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(flights[userCode])

#### Calculate total revenue of flights:          
         Total_revenue_of_flight = SUM(flights[price])

#### Calculate different number of hotels: 
         Hotels = DISTINCTCOUNT(hotels[hotelname])

#### Calculate total revenue of holes: 
         Total_revenue_of_hotels = SUM(hotels[total])

#### Calculate different number of companies: 
         Companies = DISTINCTCOUNT(users[company])
